# 2024-05-29-Into-fields

Reflecting on this week, I realized that I am no longer as obsessed with the anime “Girls Band Cry” as I was two weeks ago. I remember that two weeks ago, I would spend all my free time watching fan-made videos of GBC, never missing a single excellent one. Every Friday night at midnight, I eagerly awaited the new episode. After watching an episode, I would endure the agony and anticipation of waiting for the next Friday. Through this, I noticed that I was gradually entering what is considered the niche world of anime fandom, as these video clips typically only have a few thousand to tens of thousands of views. This made me think about my previous thoughts on learning and understanding: No matter what field you want to explore, you need to spend a certain amount of time, and this time has a minimum threshold. Any attempt to understand the field within this minimum time frame will fail. However, this does not require you to spend the majority of your time on one thing. As I mentioned when I was learning Japanese, as long as you start, even if there are times when you are not actively studying, you are still learning. So, for anything, getting to know it as early as possible is always a good thing. The next time you need it, you might only need a light touch to have a sudden realization.
