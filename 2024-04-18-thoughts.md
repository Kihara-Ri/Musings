- Humans are kind of animal of laziness. When I'm keeping doing something repeatly, I gradually try to find some tools to help me do less operations and spend less time on thinking. Just like when I create some markdown files, I'm so lazy that I don't want to type the time as the title, but I would rather make a script to help me do it automatically. Just like yesterday when I was making a Makefile file, I came out of that I'd find some tools to help me execute the Makefile whenever the files got updated so that I would not type the `make` again and again. So sometimes people prefer to make a tool to autmatically do something for them even if this thing costs them a lot of time to compelete and involves risks. Some of them are compeletely out of interest, and some of them are really out of interests. I apperiaciate it people who make wheels and share them to others all over the world. 
- When you are engaged in something, you will naturally find something needed to be optimized just out of your needs and experiences. All of the tiny things push the computer world going forward and developing consistantly.
- Thanks to my pen and the paper book! Or I almost forgot what I was thinking of when I was fill my cup with water, people are such kind of forgetful creature. So as programmer, most of the things you do may really be the same as a tailor. For us, knowing a lot of things and keep our techniques always updated is indispensable because we should always be able to find which tool is suitable for which job. What counts is that **you know what the certain thing is**, but not you know exactly how to realize one certain as you get the finity energy. One project often depends on a bunch of modules and programming languages, and every language has their own strengths so you have to use some languages to connect them, to make them work collaborativelly. Like `Python`, `Ruby`, etc. So maybe that why python has gotten a large amount of user and been developed countless packages and modules. Its ecosystem is, without doubt gorgeous! So being a Python user, you can do almost anything just using Python. Also sometimes you should just be a glue.
