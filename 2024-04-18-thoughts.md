1. Humans are kind of animal of laziness. When I'm keeping doing something repeatly, I gradually try to find some tools to help me do less operations and spend less time on thinking. Just like when I create some markdown files, I'm so lazy that I don't want to type the time as the title, but I would rather make a script to help me do it automatically. Just like yesterday when I was making a Makefile file, I came out of that I'd find some tools to help me execute the Makefile whenever the files got updated so that I would not type the `make` again and again. So sometimes people prefer to make a tool to autmatically do something for them even if this thing costs them a lot of time to compelete and involves risks. Some of them are compeletely out of interest, and some of them are really out of interests. I apperiaciate it people who make wheels and share them to others all over the world. 
2. When you are engaged in something, you will naturally find something needed to be optimized just out of your needs and experiences. All of the tiny things push the computer world going forward and developing consistantly.
