My brief journey is about to come to an end. To be honest, I don't know what I exactly did in the three days, just feeling that I have been really busy and kinda tired after everyday tour. I can say I have prepared so well that I didn't waste a lot of time on deciding where to go and how to go. I came to the aimed places and took a walk, looking around these places and took my way back. 

Most of the things in my eyes, I have to say, kind of boring. Compared with scenic spots and historical sites, I prefer to observe people, which is completely interesting.

The problem is that during the journey of short days, I didn't read any page of book, which is beyond my expect. Well, I have to speed up in the next few days.

And arrow functions in JavaScript and TypeScript. I almost forget them.
