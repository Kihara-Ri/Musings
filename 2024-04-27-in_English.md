If you want to say a good student with high score, you gonna say `Straight-A student`.

As I continue to learn English, I found that English is far more difficult than I may think. You can see a lot of people, all over the world, in streets, and when you talk to them, just like some bloggers interviews some passersby, like in Korea, Japan and even China, which countries whose people don't choose English and English-like languages as their native language and hardly speak them in daily even in English class. But those passersby, they often speak fluently. I don't know whether it's a tough stuff cause I myself is not really good at spoken English.

But when I saw some native people writing some essaies, I began to think of that whether the natives are always trying to speak as simply as them can to make the communication easily to continue. Yes, natives also use simple words to form their sentences, but the way they organize is far different from us, and most of the time, I cannot even understand why they can combine some words together and make really detailed and vivid description of their experiences, life and stories. That's what I'm far from now.
