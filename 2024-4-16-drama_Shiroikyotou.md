[白色巨塔 白い巨塔 (2003)](https://movie.douban.com/subject/2150220/?_dtcc=1)

I were not about to watch over this Japanese drama in just 3 days. But I remember last time I watched it, it was about 1 year ago and I just lay in bed and struggled to sleep cause I got something to do the next day, but I failed, so I opened it and watch the first episode. Then I hadn't been opening it one more time. The magnificence of this show goes without saying.
