        <p>This is a Japanese drama with the douban link below:</p>
        <p><a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/36156235/?_dtcc=1">重启人生 ブラッシュアップライフ (2023)</a></p>
        <p>The Japanese name is kinda interesting right? basically you can think of that as English! Brush up life tells the story of four women restarting their lives to rescue their best friends.</p>
        <p>The most interesting part of the drama I think is the plot arrangement. The story focuses on the female protagonist’s scene and situation in the first few episodes, which leads you to think about that if you got the chance to restart your own life, what would you do? You want to help others and prevent some tragedies from happening, maintaining a good relationship with friends? Or you study for your own but you find that you are gradually drifting apart from your friends? Or you want to be a superhero that saves the world? All the scenes above have been discussed in this gorgeous drama.</p>
        <p>But the drama is far more than you may thought about, otherwise I wouldn’t have written this review specifically for this show. Every scene when you were seeing at the beginning you may think of them as nonsensical and meaningless, and you just don’t know what will happen next and what they are continusly talking about. If you keep going on, you will find that the happiness and heartwarming scenes hardly come back. The four times the protagonist restarts her life, every time she chooses a new career and performs better than before, and she solves the troubles that may happen before and new challenges come up. There are times you may think that oh if I had done well, something bad would not happened. But things change as you might not expect, and also a setback may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>
        <p>For a long time, Japanese dramas have always been focusing on the relationship between people, and these people have different issues in terms of personality and psychology. So you can easily see yourself from certain characters, oh he is exactly me! You see what happens to these characters and reflect on yourself. Most of the time of your life is boring, without ups and downs, and so even you restart your life. The thing you can change is limited, but sometimes you still can think of yourself as a superhero.</p>
        <p>The last restart, the protagonist scrafices a lot of her own life just to save more people. Sounds like somewhat heroic, but the fact is that you won’t feel it at all. The core is that many people make significant contributions everywhere in our daily life, but we would never know those have happened. Every seemingly coincidental meeting is actually the inevitable result of careful planning.</p>
        <p>Thinking of this, I’m reminded of another work that shares a similar viewpoint. <a href="https://movie.douban.com/subject/26935251/">春宵苦短，少女前进吧！ 夜は短し歩けよ乙女 (2017)</a></p>
