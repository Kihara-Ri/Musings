        interests</h1>
        <p>I’ve found I’m the kind of person who is just engaged in
        things that intriggles my interest and often get addicted in it.
        When I get the passion, I would be able to work for hours, even
        for several hours. I know this is a gift for me only if I’m
        doing what I really like.</p>
        <p>But sometimes you know as a student, a worker, a person, you
        gotta do a bunch of things that you don’t really like, and you
        have to endure everything. This is not something you should
        blame, cause the world and our life is like this. So it makes me
        feel distress when I have to do things that I don’t like to do.
        What even more distress is that anything that you like to do
        contains things you don’t like to do, so what you want to do may
        be just a small part of the certain thing.</p>
        <p>You may have seen that some people show really cool skills
        and you just see the surface and you tried to intimate what
        other people do, and you got to find that something really
        difficult, tedious and boring. Then you gave up or find other
        thing of interest to do. Most of us don’t get a lot of skills
        and talents, and we often rely on just one or two skills to
        live, and may not really get a talent on this. So when I see
        someone with superb skills, I believe they are very hardworking
        and have overcome their inherent laziness.</p>
