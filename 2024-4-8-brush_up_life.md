This is a Japanese drama with the douban link below:

[重启人生 ブラッシュアップライフ (2023)](https://movie.douban.com/subject/36156235/?_dtcc=1)

Japanese name is kinda interesting right? basically you can think of that as English! Brush up life tells the story of four women restarting their lives to rescue their best friends.

The most interesting part of the drama I think is the plot arrangement. The story focuses on the female protagonist's scene and situation in the first few episodes, which leads you to think about that if you got the chance to restart your own life, what would you do? You want to help others and prevent some tragedies from happening, maintaining a good relationship with friends? Or you study for your own but you find that you are gradually drifting apart from your friends? Or you want to be a superhero that saves the world? All the scene above have been discussed in this gorgeous drama.
