# Musings

A respository for musings, all in English.

Musings about daily life, art works, films, books, etc. All kinds of thoughts.

> This is a repository that records my musings in the form of markdown, with the keeping of several days and expansion of knowledge, I found that I gradually generated some new demands and I'm trying to meet all of my needs and so is what this repository looks like. At first I just kept the markdown files and push them to this repository, then I made a Makefile workflow to help me generate files and html automatically, I made a `touchf` command in this directory to help me start my record rapidly. These tools developped by early grogrammers are really interesting! and I will keep learning them in the future, maybe the contents of this repository will be shown to more people in another cooler form.

It's a really long time I haven't written any essays in English. For a long time I have always been speaking and writing with my native language, Chinese. But there comes the serious issue: I'm going to study aborad and get a good grade in my TOEFL test, but the fact is that I've hardly even started. I've heard a lot of people some of them are studying or working aborad and some are just like, have never been abroad, but all of them speak foreign languages very well, they talk with foreigners fluently and without any barriers.

Actually, I'm learning Japanese and I've decided to study abroad in Japan in the second half of the year. But when I open bilibili and YouTube videos, I see so many Chinese people who are the same age as me, but they just keep speaking with what they come up with, really like a native speaker. I feel kind of troubled and anxious, why I haven't been one of them? What have I been passive in learning English until now? 

What I think the most important thing for every one is mind. How to get to understand that? For me, when I want to do something, maybe I'm busy working on my important work, but the time I do not really want to do that, I will immediately shift my focus and engage in that interesting thing. So it is always said that interest is the best teacher, and ethusiasm is the best motivator. So you want to keep learning knowledge, the key may not be an iron will or self-discipline, but the mind that you want to do.

For instance, I've long been negative in learning mathematics since I've been an undergraduate, and the premise is I performed compeletely well in my high school years. So you can see the reason a person do not want to keep learning something may not be that he is not good at it, he just loses his enthusiasm or motivation in this field. So in my perspective, the way you solve the problem is that you get try to stimulate yourself and want to be as strong as those people who have achieved.

In this case, one of the most common scene is that many Chinese people have always been saying "Oh I am a Chinese, why I'm gonna speak English well?" If you keep that in mind, you won't be speaking well. We should think out of the box, if you gonna be speaking a foreign language like native speakers, you should try to use them as much as possible. Writing and speaking all count.

This is an era of ongoing globalization, every person is not just belong to one certain country and tied to it. If you want to get used to this world and find more chances, keep learning is always important, and languages are always an important tool for you to communicate with not only the people who speak that kind of language but also the culture.

So, do something and find why you like to learn a language!
