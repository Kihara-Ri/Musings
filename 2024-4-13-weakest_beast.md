[无法成为野兽的我们 獣になれない私たち (2018)](https://movie.douban.com/subject/30290917/?_dtcc=1)

Although the ratings aren't very high, after watching it, I personaly think this Japanese drama is worthy a discussion and meditation.

This drama tells a story of mainly five people:

- Akira Shinkai, the main character, who works efficiently and performs well in the workplace. Looks like she is a perfect woman from every perspective, but in fact she has been distressed and exhausted from enduring the scrutiny and tolerance from those around her.
- Kyouya Hanai, a man similar to Akira, who is an elite in a major company, tormented by his gentleness and sense of responsibility towards his ex-girlfriend.
- Kousei Nemoto, the male protagonist, unlike the two characters above, he knows how to live for himself and is able to say no. But in some scene, no matter how strong a man is, there are still dilemmas difficult to make choices. This is what the real society is.
- Kureba Tachibana, a woman who is very sincere in relationships and has a free-spirited nature.
- Shuri Nagato, who after being knocked down in the workplace, is unable to face reality and becomes a hikigomori. Many viewers dislike this character, finding her completely unreasonable, and they attribute the faults in the show's storyline to his character development.

I must say one thing. In fact, as an audience, you get to accept and try to understand what the direct trys to convey to you, instead of blaming a fictional character's morals and values.

I personally think this Japanese drama discusses people's growth. While it contains emotional elements, there's hardly any genuine happiness or the so-called 'sugar-coating'--a behavior I particularly dislike. The author doesn't overly please the audience; instead, he constantly prompts viewers to reflect: What is your current situation like? Can you understand others? Do you have the courage to step out of the cage that confines you? The character Shuri in the drama is indeed an odd presence, but such people exist in reality too. Many cannot accept how those around her tolerate or even help her, and so on. But I think, if it really happened to me, I wouldn't resolve things very harshly either, because after all, I can't be a beast in real society. Calming down, these scenarios seem fantastical and exaggerated, but they are not uncommon in real life... That's all for now.
